# Theme changer V1 for the Homepage
Soon There would be ** Theme changer ** where you could change the visual look based on what you want to preffer and have fun. 
The most fun part which could be added  is **inbuilt games ** ! (Remember, ** inbuilt games ** is not finalized to be added, it's still on hold) 
After finalising about the inbuilt games, we would add a notice for it.

### the current chosen themes are:
- Dark fluent (default) and light fluent UIs
- retro UI
- minecraft style UI
- technology UI
- material UI UI

The theme changer would be soon released so please hold tight and sit down! 

> Meanwhile you can suggest us more themes where we could put it in too!
