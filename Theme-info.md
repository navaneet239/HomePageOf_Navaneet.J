# Theme changer v1 for the Homepage
Soon theme changers would be added in the site where you could choose your preffered visual look!

The most fun part which could be added  is inbuilt games! (Remember, inbuilt games is not finalized to be added, it's still on hold) 
After finalising about the inbuilt games, we would add a notice for it.

### Current themes to be added:

- Dark fluent (default) or Light fluent UIs
- Retro UI
- Minecraft style UI
- Material based UI
